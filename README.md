# Language Detection
Language detection using 'Roberta' from HuggingFace with FastAPI as the backend. 

## Setup
- Install all dependencies, run `pip install -r requirements.txt` or `install.sh` 
  - OR, 
    - Create `python -m venv .env` virtual env
    - run `activate_env_linux.sh`(if using linux) or `activate_env_windows.bat`
    - then install all the dependencies
- Run `run_server.sh` to consume/test rest endpoints

## Model Tests
- Run `python local_detector_test.py` to test the model with some test data

## API Unit Tests
- Run `pytest` or `run_tests.sh` to test the rest API endpoints

## API Docs & Specifications
 All docs & specs are automatically generated by Swagger or ReDoc built-in within FastAPI.
 - To check `Swagger` use `/docs`
 - To check `Redoc` use `/redoc`

## GPU Support
No, as the project is a small demo and will be hosted on free resources

## Model & Supported Languages
Model is [xlm-roberta-base-language-detection](https://huggingface.co/papluca/xlm-roberta-base-language-detection`) model from HuggingFace. Which is a fine tuned version of [xlm-roberta-base](https://huggingface.co/xlm-roberta-base) trained on [Language ID Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/papluca/language-identification#additional-information).
